	<h1>David Guetta feat. Justin Bieber- 2U</h1>
	<p>No limit in the sky<br>
	That I won't fly for ya<br>
	No amount of tears in my eyes<br>
	That I won't cry for ya, oh no<br>
	With every breath that I take<br>
	I want you to share that air with me<br>
	There's no promise that I won't keep<br>
	I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep</p>
	
	<p>When it comes to you<br>
	There's no crime<br>
	Let's take both of our souls<br>
	And intertwine<br>
	When it comes to you<br>
	Don't be blind<br>
	Watch me speak from my heart<br>
	When it comes to you, comes to you</p>
